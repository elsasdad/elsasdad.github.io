                                of change is varied, so are human responses. Some people are frustrated and disoriented by
                                changes that confront them. Others find the
                                prospect of uncertainty invigorating. One thing is for certain, everyone thinks their response is
                                justified.

Conservers prefer change that is gradual and incremental. The Conserver style advocates for continuous improvement while minimizing chaos and uncertainty.

                                existing rules, policy and structure. Pragmatists prefer change that is functional. While they
                                are able to see multiple perspectives, they are
                                most interested in what will work and seems most practical. However, the more a Pragmatist

                                Originator side of the continuum, the more they will express a change style reflective of that

                                "Because you have an S style, Richard, you’re likely a cooperative person who takes pride in doing your part to help the team. You probably don’t need to win to feel good about yourself. In fact, when you receive credit for a job well done, you may be quick to share it with others.
                                <br><br>
                                You probably tend to be fairly accommodating, and you may find it important to maintain the approval of others. Consequently, you’re likely to put a fair amount of energy into catering to other people. In fact, at times you may have difficulty saying no, and you may fail to let people know when you’ve been inconvenienced.
                                Since you have a need for harmony, conflict is probably difficult for you. Most likely, you’re troubled by the idea of hurting someone’s feelings, and you may spend time dwelling on

                                incidents that other people wouldn’t think twice about. In group situations, you may prefer the role of peacemaker, but when things become heated, you may shut down and simply wait for the tension to pass.
                                <br><br>
                                Most likely, you’re fairly comfortable working quietly behind the scenes. While you like to feel appreciated, you may get somewhat embarrassed if the praise is too public or gushing. And, because you sometimes downplay your own performance, others may fail to recognize your contributions altogether.
                                <br><br>
                                Because you’re often trusting, you probably give people the benefit of the doubt. Likewise, when people present new ideas, you may try to keep an open mind and show support. And, if someone fails to meet your expectations, you’d sometimes rather redo the work than give negative feedback because you don’t want to damage the relationship.
                                <br><br>
                                You tend to be soft-spoken, and your fear of speaking out of turn may cause you to keep ideas to yourself. And, because you sometimes speak hesitantly and qualify your statements, others may find your ideas unconvincing. However, because filtering your responses comes so naturally to you, you may not realize how much more efficient it would be to say exactly what you’re thinking.
                                <br><br>
                                Compared to others, you probably have more patience for long, routine projects. Because you like stability, you may prefer to have procedures to guide your work. Similarly, you want to have a clear understanding of what’s expected of you so that you don’t let anyone down. You probably feel most secure when you’ve perfected a set of specialized skills that you can perform reliably.
                                <br><br>
                                You tend to be on the careful side, avoiding risk when possible. Because you assume that rules and traditions are there for a reason, you probably dislike shortcuts. When considering bold changes, you may focus more on the possibility of failure than on the potential benefits. You may require quite a bit of certainty before making major decisions, and this indecisiveness can stand in the way of progress.

                                Richard, like others with the S style, your most valuable contributions to the workplace may include your acceptance of others, your dependability, and your ability to be a team player.

Furthermore, because tense situations make you uncomfortable, you may be happy to go along with ideas even if you don’t necessarily agree with them. You’re willing to put your own needs aside in the interest of giving others support.

Since you prefer a calm and harmonious environment, you probably focus on avoiding surprises and keeping things predictable. Likewise, you do your best to provide consistency, and people know they can count on you to follow through. Because a calm, secure environment is important to you, you put your energy into maintaining stability.

Most likely, you want to be seen as a team player, and you do your best to make sure everyone feels included and heard. Because you tend to see others’ points of view, you’re able to provide the empathy that makes people feel understood and accepted. You focus on making personal connections by collaborating to create a warm, friendly environment.

You probably prefer to get going right away, and you may become impatient with obstacles that stand in your way. You’re unlikely to be intimidated by rapid change or the need to improvise. Once you’ve chosen a course of action, you tend to stick to it and keep moving.

                                Furthermore, because you don’t like feeling constrained, you value freedom and don’t bow to conformity.

The right path may often seem straightforward to you, and you aren’t afraid to communicate your beliefs. In fact, according to our research, the most pronounced strength of leaders with the Di style is the ability to show confidence in their opinions. And because you usually have strong feelings about how things should be done, you aren’t afraid to step in and correct the process if it strays from your vision.

Most likely, your self-assurance and verbal skills make it easy for you to describe how you think things should be. While this can be a great benefit, it can also cause problems if you’re so focused on your own ideas that you shut down other people. In fact, almost half of the people in our surveys want leaders who share your Di style to be more open to input from others. Still, you probably find the act of influencing people very gratifying, both one-on-one and in team settings. For you, sharing your passion is about connecting with people and helping them see new possibilities for the future.

Learning agility is primarily an indicator of adaptability rather than of intelligence. And although intelligence influences the ability to learn from a traditional perspective, learning agility is a different and distinct trait that is not significantly correlated with intelligence.

                            <li><b>Working with and relating to people</b><br>
                                The assessment indicates that you are interpersonally savvy. You can shift easily between different job roles and build relationships with a diversity of people at work. You tend to be skilled at influencing others and leveraging others' skills to get the job done. You are sensitive to the politics and can manage conflict constructively.</li>
                            <li><b>Tolerance for uncertainty and ability to lead change</b><br>
                                Your scores imply that you generally embrace change and often lead change initiatives at work. You tend to be future oriented, take quick and decisive actions, and-willingly take risks. You get bored with routine, repetitive activities and enjoy experimenting with new approaches. In those instances when things do not go well, you readily accept responsibility.</li>
                            <li><b>Preference for how to get things done</b><br>
                                The results reveal that you likely are a consistent performer. Although you prefer a stable environment, you are willing to go outside of your comfort zone if required. Typically, you do not rush to action. Rather you prefer to think things through and carefully plan your work activities. Generally, you focus on near-term goals and prefer to accomplish one set of tasks before moving to another.</li>
                            <li><b>Interest in and extent of self-reflection</b><br>
                                The assessment shows that you wish to know what others think of you but do not proactively seek their feedback. When others' feedback does not confirm your self-perceptions, you tend to doubt their judgment. Although you may be aware of your impact on people, you do not adjust your behavior to their reactions. Sometimes you feel that your strengths are not being fully recognized by others.</li>

                                Richard is a direct, results-oriented person who considers people within the framework of his objectives. He expects his goals to be attained, and he wants to be recognised for his own accomplishments. By slowing down occasionally he is more able to gather relevant data and consider both the practical and personal ramifications of his actions. He may lose interest and move on to the next thing, once a job becomes routine or dull. He is strong on initiative and creativity, but may often be weak on the completion of projects.
                                <br><br>
                                In developing the success of his “vision” he may unconsciously tend to compare himself with the success of others, disassociating himself from the envy that this process may generate. He prefers to be direct, results oriented and thorough, whilst not always taking time to give real consideration to others. Highly independent, Richard enjoys speculative and imaginative activities and work. He is less suited to work that ties him down to routine details. He finds it hard to concentrate for long periods on this kind of work, becoming bored and frustrated. He likes to make sure that he knows what is going on and tries to make sure that everyone is pulling their weight.
                                <br><br>
                                Richard gains motivation from his ability to generate ideas. His almost permanently positive state can often carry others with him. Richard is a resourceful, action-oriented person who lives for the future by making every moment count. He is a natural manager and finds himself in command through his ability to plan and keep both long and short-term objectives clearly in mind. He has started many interesting projects in his time, but has finished considerably fewer. Logical, analytical and critical, achieving power is important to him. He will be prepared to constantly defend any stance or position he may have taken.
                                <br><br>
                                Eager to add to his knowledge, Richard is passionate about researching significant new subjects that capture his interest. Writing important facts or steps down on paper helps him keep from getting side-tracked, but he may lack the discipline necessary to do this well. Richard is an innovator, always aware of new possibilities and different ways of doing things. He can find it hard to concentrate on the small details and he may get bored with projects quickly. Richard enjoys work that involves moving projects forward.
                                <br><br>
                                He prefers to combine creative decision making with limited reflection. Lively and entertaining, and with infectious energy, he needs change and variety in order to be at his best. Routine work and administration is of little interest to him, though unexplored and unexpected elements of a job often aren't considered work at all. His ability to do detailed work extends only to that work which is necessary to achieve a specific objective: that ability is there however, particularly if the goal is clearly defined. His life will tend to be a series of initiated, but unfinished projects.

                            <li class="noBull">
                                Richard enjoys involvement in many activities, with a variety of people. He is stimulated by doing the unexpected or the unusual. Errors made by others may upset him and cause him to react loudly and vociferously. He prefers what might be, rather than the reality of what is already. He can be a good team player, but does like a somewhat individual approach. He is gifted with insight amounting to a quick wisdom and is able to persuade others to follow.
                                <br><br>
                                Although he may fail to recognise the symptoms, he can become rather uncomfortable if separated from his family or group for long periods of time. He likes to lead rather than manage, is normally fair but demanding and will not always be willing to accept change without first knowing why. He can be exceedingly stubborn and independent when faced with change or new ideas if they are not his own. He may become rebellious or sulk if people try to railroad him or interfere in his plans. Richard's ingenuity, warmth and his understanding of others allows him to proceed through life with great confidence. He is very effective in a leadership role, able to persuade others of the value of his vision.
                                <br><br>
                                Seen by most people as outgoing, flexible and fearless, Richard can rise to meet any challenge. Richard has a remarkable ability to get people to follow his lead. He deals imaginatively with social relationships which generate a large variety of acquaintances. He is a “networking” expert. Richard exudes charismatic charm and a natural ability to communicate well. Unconventional in approach and enjoying motivating others to exceed what is accepted and expected, he likes to live freely, looking for variety every day.

                            <li class="noBull">
                                Richard is inquisitive, versatile, adaptable and resourceful in solving challenging, theoretical problems. He prefers tasks or projects which allow flexibility of scheduling. He prefers to make decisions based on “gut feel” rather than on exhaustive and repetitive analysis. Constantly generating ideas, he sometimes has trouble focusing on just one thing at a time and can find difficulty in making consistent and lasting decisions. He is a good, practical judge of character, and tends to use intuition where both people and decisions are concerned.
                                <br><br>
                                Work that uses his ideas to improve or start a project suits him, but once these ideas get off the ground he prefers someone else to carry on with the details. Others may see his decisions as unrealistic in certain circumstances. Always restless, he would rather ignore or put off dealing with troublesome details, by preferring to move on to something new or unusual. He may be perceived by others as a somewhat impulsive decision maker. He may constantly test the limits of a situation and he considers that most rules and regulations are there to be bent, if not broken.
                                <br><br>
                                He may have so many ideas on the go that he has difficulty in making up his mind on the best course of action. Through his intuitive feeling personality, he may have difficulty in limiting himself to a single project and usually prefers to keep many balls in the air. He sees so many possibilities that he sometimes has difficulty selecting the best activity or interest to pursue, or in keeping to the agreed track. He may find it difficult to make decisions based purely on objective considerations. He is outgoing, versatile and quick-witted, and may have an endless supply of solutions to whatever challenge he finds himself in.

                                You are fascinated by ideas. What is an idea? An idea is a concept, the best explanation of the most events. You are delighted when you discover beneath the complex surface an elegantly simple concept to explain why things are the way they are. An idea is a connection. Yours is the kind of mind that is always looking for connections, and so you are intrigued when seemingly disparate phenomena can be linked by an obscure connection. An idea is a new perspective on familiar challenges. You revel in taking the world we all know and turning it around so we can view it from a strange but strangely enlightening angle. You love all these ideas because they are profound, because they are novel, because they are clarifying, because they are contrary, because they are bizarre. For all these reasons you derive a jolt of energy whenever a new idea occurs to you. Others may label you creative or original or conceptual or even smart. Perhaps you are all of these. Who can be sure? What you are sure of is that ideas are thrilling. And on most days this is enough.

                                The Strategic theme enables you to sort through the clutter and find the best route. It is not a skill that can be taught. It is a distinct way of thinking, a special perspective on the world at large. This perspective allows you to see patterns where others simply see complexity. Mindful of these patterns, you play out alternative scenarios, always asking, "What if this happened? Okay, well what if this happened?" This recurring question helps you see around the next corner. There you can evaluate accurately the potential obstacles. Guided by where you see each path leading, you start to make selections. You discard the paths that lead nowhere. You discard the paths that lead straight into resistance. You discard the paths that lead into a fog of confusion. You cull and make selections until you arrive at the chosen path-your strategy. Armed with your strategy, you strike forward. This is your Strategic theme at work: "What if?" Select. Strike.

                            <li class="noBull">
                                You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, you will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you. You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence. The thrill of the first few facts, the early efforts to recite or practice what you have learned, the growing confidence of a skill mastered-this is the process that entices you. Your excitement leads you to engage in adult learning experiences-yoga or piano lessons or graduate classes. It enables you to thrive in dynamic work environments where you are asked to take on short project assignments and are expected to learn a lot about the new subject matter in a short period of time and then move on to the next one. This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the subject matter expert, or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less significant than the "getting there."

                                Your Achiever theme helps explain your drive. Achiever describes a constant need for achievement. You feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day you must achieve something tangible in order to feel good about yourself. And by "every day" you mean every single day-workdays, weekends, vacations. No matter how much you may feel you deserve a day of rest, if the day passes without some form of achievement, no matter how small, you will feel dissatisfied. You have an internal fire burning inside you. It pushes you to do more, to achieve more. After each accomplishment is reached, the fire dwindles for a moment, but very soon it rekindles itself, forcing you toward the next accomplishment. Your relentless need for achievement might not be logical. It might not even be focused. But it will always be with you. As an Achiever you must learn to live with this whisper of discontent. It does have its benefits. It brings you the energy you need to work long hours without burning out. It is the jolt you can always count on to get you started on new tasks, new challenges. It is the power supply that causes you to set the pace and define the levels of productivity for your work group. It is the theme that keeps you moving.

                                You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information-words, facts, books, and quotations-or you might collect tangible objects such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs. Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. And yours is the kind of mind that finds so many things interesting. The world is exciting precisely because of its infinite variety and complexity. If you read a great deal, it is not necessarily to refine your theories but, rather, to add more information to your archives. If you like to travel, it is because each new location offers novel artifacts and facts. These can be acquired and then stored away. Why are they worth storing? At the time of storing it is often hard to say exactly when or why you might need them, but who knows when they might become useful? With all those possible uses in mind, you really don't feel comfortable throwing anything away. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It's interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove valuable.

                            <li class="noBull">
                                ENTPs are inventors, innovators, explorers, entrepreneurs, and visionaries. ENTPs are always looking over the next horizon, trying to push the edge of the envelope, and trying to do what other people say can't be done. What is: is never good enough. ENTPs have a vision of what could be and a powerful drive to turn their visions into reality.
                                <br><br>
                                ENTPs value progress and change, both in their personal lives and in the world as a whole. The idea of a static, unchanging life: appealing to some SJs: is abhorrent to an ENTP. ENTPs are always seeking out new experiences, new ideas, and new achievements. While other types may worry that the world is changing too fast, ENTPs are more likely to be frustrated that the world isn't changing fast enough: in the direction they want it to move.
                                <br><br>
                                Like other NTs, ENTPs tend to have a rational, empirical view of the world and often have a strong and early interest in science and technology – but this worldview and these interests are expressed differently in each of the types.
                                <br><br>
                                While an INTP may be content to design a system or even just prove it is possible to design a system: ENTPs want to design and build the system and see it working with their own eyes. In this way, they resemble INTJs in their goals: but not in their approach toward achieving those goals. ENTPs are likely to have bursts of inspiration that are translated into reality through intermittent periods of extremely intense activity.
                                <br><br>
                                ENTPs tend to be sociable: they enjoy interacting with interesting people and doing interesting things with others. The key word is "interesting". ENTPs have a low boredom threshold, and unlike EF-types, they have little desire to be around other people simply for the sake of being around other people.
                                More than other NTs, ENTPs value intense experiences: including emotional experiences: and are less likely than other NTs to attempt to suppress their emotions. When ENTPs are up, they're on top of the world, facing unlimited possibilities, unbounded horizons, and an exhilarating future. When ENTPs are down, the universe lacks any redeeming qualities, whatsoever.
                                <br><br>
                                ENTPs are risk-takers: flying, skydiving, scuba diving, hang gliding, mountain climbing, and fast cars all have a strong appeal for ENTPs. Unlike STP risk-takers, however, ENTPs are less likely to become experts in a particular activity, and more likely to sample many different experiences.
                                <br><br>
                                ENTPs have little respect for rules that fail to serve a useful purpose. Rules that significantly inhibit the ability to get things done will be changed, finessed, or simply ignored.
                                <br><br>
                                While ENTPs value their personal relationships, they find it easier than some other types (in particular, NFs and SFJs) to leave those relationships behind. An ESFJ, for example, might be terrified by the thought of leaving all of their friends behind and moving alone to a new city. An ENTP in the same situation may miss those friends, but at the same time be looking forward to the new people, new places, new experiences, and new opportunities they may find in their new environment.</li>
